# submod

A command line tool for modifying the timing of movie subtitle files.

The python version of submod was the first complete program I wrote when learning programming.

Since I’m still nostalgic for those days, and because I’m not creative enough to come up with new trivial programs to learn Golang, I’ve rewritten it in Go.
